# Mobile Accordion Fix - Testing Guide

**File:** `homepage-template.html`  
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: Mobile Accordion Not Displaying as Accordion ✅
**Problem:** Mobile menu was showing as dropdown card (like tablet) instead of accordion with expandable sections.

**Solution:**
- Improved accordion toggle JavaScript with proper event handling
- Added visual arrow indicators (› rotates to ∨ when expanded)
- Better styling for narrow mobile viewports
- Enhanced accordion content transitions (opacity + max-height)

### Issue #2: Sticky Header Behavior ✅
**Problem:** Mobile menu wasn't sticking to top after scrolling.

**Solution:**
```css
@media (max-width: 767px) {
    .banner-header-main {
        position: sticky;
        top: 0;
        z-index: 100;
    }
    
    .banner-header-main .mobile-accordion {
        position: absolute;
        top: 100%;  /* Attached to bottom of header */
    }
}
```

### Issue #3: Auto-Close on Viewport Resize ✅
**Problem:** Accordion stayed open when expanding to desktop.

**Solution:**
- Resize listener closes accordion at 1150px+ (desktop breakpoint)
- Cleans up all active states properly

### Test 2: Sticky Header Behavior (Mobile)

## 🐛 Debugging

If accordion isn't working, check:

1. **Console Logs:**
   - Should see: "Accordion solutions: opened/closed"
   - Look for any JavaScript errors

2. **Element Inspection:**
   - Check if `.mobile-accordion` has `.active` class
   - Check if `.accordion-content` has `.active` class
   - Verify `max-height` is increasing when open

3. **CSS:**
   - Verify `position: sticky` on `.banner-header-main`
   - Check `position: absolute` on `.mobile-accordion`
   - Confirm `top: 100%` is set
