   * Manual initialization via JavaScript  
   * Refresh existing blog groups  
2. **Smart Post Count:**

   * BlogTeaser: Always 2 posts

   * Infinite: Loads up to 100 posts  
3. **Category Filtering:**

   * Just need to add WordPress category IDs after setup  
4. **Complete Data Handling:**

5. **Pagination Support:**

### **Phase 2 Implementation Steps:**

When you're ready to connect to WordPress:

1. **Update the category IDs** after creating them in WordPress:

BlogGroupAdapter.config.categories\['email-marketing'\] \= 5;  
BlogGroupAdapter.config.categories\['content-creation'\] \= 6;  
// etc...

2. **Add data attributes** to your HTML:

\<section class="blog-group" id="homepage-blog"   
         data-blog-group="frontpage"   
         data-blog-category="all"\>  
    \<\!-- Your existing HTML structure \--\>  
\</section\>

3. **Include the adapter** after your blog-group HTML:

\<script src="/scripts/blog-group-adapter.js"\>\</script\>

That's it\! The adapter will automatically:

* Find all blog groups on the page  
* Fetch content from WordPress  
* Populate your beautiful design with real posts  
* Handle all the responsive behavior

### **Your Launch Categories:**

Based on your description, here's the category structure I've prepared for:

1. **Welcome/Announcements** \- For your launch post  
2. **Email Marketing** \- Your core expertise  
3. **Content Creation** \- Lead magnets, blogs, etc.  
4. **AI in Marketing** \- Working with AI tools  
5. **Succession Planning** \- Exit strategies  
6. **Webinar Production** \- Your specialty service  
7. **SEO Optimization** \- B2B SEO strategies  
8. **Professional Development** \- Career/skills content

The adapter is ready to handle all of these once you have the WordPress categories set up\!

### **The Beauty of This Approach:**

* **Zero changes** to our current HTML/CSS  
* **Progressive enhancement** \- Works without JavaScript, enhanced with it  
* **Easy testing** \- Can use mock data before WordPress is ready  
* **Flexible deployment** \- Works with both traditional WordPress and headless setups

You're absolutely right that we're setting this up the right way. When you start looking at WordPress next week, you'll have a clear path from static Phase 1 to dynamic Phase 2\! ðŸš€
