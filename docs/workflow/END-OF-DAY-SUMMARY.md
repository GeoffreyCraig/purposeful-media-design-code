## 🔍 Questions to Answer Tomorrow

### CSS Build Questions:
1. Does `master-styles.css` import `organisms-headers.css`?
2. Does `master-styles.css` import `organisms-footers.css`?
3. Are header/footer styles in the built `purposeful-main.min.css`?
4. Do we need to rebuild after adding imports?

### Asset Path Questions:
1. Where are logo SVG files located?
2. What's the correct path from templates/ to assets/?
3. Do paths work when opened from browser?
4. Will paths work in WordPress (different structure)?

### Component Questions:
1. Do header/footer have embedded styles or use external CSS?
2. Are there any missing CSS files we haven't included?
3. Does the built CSS include all organisms we're using?

## 💡 Key Learnings Today

### What Went Well ✅
1. Build process setup was smooth (npm install worked perfectly)
2. Text block organism is comprehensive and well-documented
3. CSS/JS bundling worked on first try
4. Your multi-color icon design decision was validated (40KB CSS is justified)

### What Needs Attention 🎯
1. Template integration is more complex than I anticipated
2. Header and footer are substantial organisms with many features
3. Asset paths need careful attention (templates → assets)
4. Need to slow down and ensure completeness before moving forward

### Good Process Decisions 🌟
1. Your phased approach (MVW → Phase 2 → Phase 3) is smart
2. Speed run deployment strategy will catch issues early
3. Building complete organisms first makes templates easier
4. Stopping tonight to review tomorrow is wise

## 💭 Reflection

**Today was productive but fast-paced:**
- ✅ Completed major milestones (build system, text block)
- ✅ Made significant progress (80% of Phase 1)
- ⚠️ Moved too quickly on templates (incomplete integration)
- ✅ Good stopping point for review and refinement

**Your feedback was helpful:**
- Caught the missing header/footer
- Identified the need to slow down
- Smart to review before proceeding

**Tomorrow will be cleaner:**
- Focused scope (complete homepage)
- Slower pace (ensure quality)
- Clear deliverable (working static page)
- Better foundation for Figma template work

---

## 🎯 Success Metric for Tomorrow

**Definition of "Complete Static Homepage":**
- ✅ Full header with logo and navigation
- ✅ Complete hero section
- ✅ All content sections (10 total)
- ✅ Full footer with menus and newsletter
- ✅ All CSS loading correctly
- ✅ All icons displaying
- ✅ All spacing/margins correct
- ✅ Responsive at all breakpoints
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Looks professional and polished

**When this is done,** you'll have a complete static homepage to review before we tackle the WordPress theme and other templates from Figma.
