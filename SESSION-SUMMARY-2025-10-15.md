## 🔧 Technical Challenges Solved

### Challenge 1: SVG Icons Not Displaying
**Problem:** Icon sprite sheets not copied, relative paths didn't work  
**Solution:** 
- Copied both sprite sheets to theme
- Added PHP-generated absolute paths in `header.php`
- All icons now display correctly

### Challenge 2: Mobile Accordion Positioning (The Big One!)
**Problem:** Mobile menu had wrong vertical positioning and scroll behavior  
**Evolution:**
1. First attempt: Changed to `position: sticky` - didn't work as expected
2. Second attempt: Added sticky to header - overcomplicated
3. Third attempt: Used `position: absolute` - static positioning
4. Fourth attempt: JavaScript toggle between two states - "springy" behavior
5. **FINAL SOLUTION:** JavaScript calculates position frame-by-frame

**Working Solution:**
```javascript
const newTop = Math.max(0, 125 - scrollPosition);
mobileAccordion.style.top = newTop + 'px';
```

**Result:** Menu moves in perfect lock-step with header, sticks at top smoothly

### Challenge 3: ACF Integration with Smart Fallbacks
**Problem:** Empty ACF fields caused carousel to break  
**Solution:** 
- Check if repeater has actual content (not just empty rows)
- Fall back to default slides if no content
- Site always displays properly

## 💡 Key Learnings & Techniques

### Technique 1: Dynamic Scroll-Based Positioning
```javascript
const newTop = Math.max(0, startPosition - scrollPosition);
element.style.top = newTop + 'px';
```
**Use case:** Elements that need to move with scroll until reaching a stick point

### Technique 2: WordPress Absolute Asset Paths
```php
<style>
.icon-display {
    background-image: url('<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/path/to/file.svg') !important;
}
</style>
```
**Use case:** Override relative CSS paths with WordPress-aware absolute URLs

### Technique 3: Smart ACF Fallbacks
```php
if (have_rows('field')) :
    $has_content = false;
    while (have_rows('field')) : the_row();
        if (get_sub_field('key_field')) {
            $has_content = true;
        }
    endwhile;
endif;

if ($has_content) {
    // Show ACF content
} else {
    // Show fallback
}
```
**Use case:** Graceful degradation when ACF fields are empty
